## COT indicator

### Instalation

Put the folder into `MQL5/Indicators` folder. Then open it in MetaEditor and
press `Compile` button. After that it should appear in the MetaTrader's 
experts folder. 
Indicator needs data to work properly. So you need to put 
`cot_indicator/cot` folder into `Files` folder.

### Data updates

The indicator doesn't download data automatically. So every week you 
need to download the new version of `cot_indicator/cot` into `Files`
folder.
